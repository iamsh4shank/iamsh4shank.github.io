Selected as a mentor for The Mifos Initiative for there Android Client project. Android Field operation application based on Mifos X is a robust core banking platform that is developed for field officers using which they process transactions, keep track of their clientâ€™s data, center records, group details, and manage different types of accounts (loan, savings and recurring) of the client. I helped in the development of mobile banking app on top of the Apache Fineract architecture, worked on projects like android client and android SDK based on Fineract APIs
