Worked with Dr. Yisroel Mirsky and his team on a project related to Machine Learning funded by Israel Cyber Array. It involves creating and running algorithms on several new adversarial attacks to modify the automatic defense algorithm being tested on adaptive adversaries. I also added a few confidentiality attacks such as Memebrship Inference and Model Extraction Attack to the [ART](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox) library.
