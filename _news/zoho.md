Selected as a summer research intern at Zoho Labs. Here I worked on developing a module to detect visual symmetry in textual data for URL spoofing by modifying the Levenshtein distance algorithm and Neural Network. The other major project where I was invloved with was on creating algorithms for performing operations such as AND, OR, and NOT for Sanskrit statements (using
DhatuNet) similar to WordNet, it can be used in several Sanskrit semantic tasks. Also wrote APIs for DhatuNet.
