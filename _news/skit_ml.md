Selected as an ML Engineering Intern at Skit.ai. Being a core ML intern I worked on making Skit Text-to-Speech(TTS) middleware compatible with Google TTS and Azure TTS by adding
features to handle transliteration, contextual num2words, and so on. I also generated bench-marking dataset using Polly and Azure APIs to train TTS model. Worked on creating the Kubeflow pipeline and components for Language Modeling tuning for ASR which lead to reduced time in the training and evaluation workflow.
