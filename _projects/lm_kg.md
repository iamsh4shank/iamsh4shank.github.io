Working on analyzing the effect of integrating Language models with Knowledge Graph to complement the text
data, offering better and more structured background knowledge for reasoning. The general approach here is to use the
combination of transformers and GNNs for extracting both modalities followed by passing them through fusion layers.
Last pretraining them using Masked Language Modeling and KG Link Prediction.
