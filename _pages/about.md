Hi there, I am passionate about exploring how security and privacy can be enhanced in the fields of AI. As AI systems become more sophisticated and widely deployed, the risks posed by adversarial attacks are becoming increasingly significant. It's crucial that we understand the vulnerabilities of AI systems and develop effective strategies for defending against these attacks.

I spend a lot of my time researching the latest developments in adversarial AI and thinking about how we can make AI systems more robust and secure. Whether it's exploring novel attack methods or developing innovative defense strategies, I am always eager to learn more and deepen my understanding of this critical field.

I also love reading about advancements in Computer Vision (like object detection or image segmentation) and LLMs (integration with Neuroscience) or AI in general.

In short -

* :rocket: I'm currently exploring security in AI, Visual Computing, and MLOps.
* :speech_balloon: Ask me about open source, computer vision, deep learning, android development, and how communities works.
